## Overview

**Galaxy Web App** is inspired by the concept of adding commentary and interactive features to video playback, reminiscent of the beloved show *Mystery Science Theater 3000*. Users can choose from a library of videos, add comments in real-time, and play them back with their annotations synced to the video timeline. This allows for a unique collaborative viewing experience that enhances the enjoyment and understanding of video content.

### How It Works

- **Video Selection:** Users can browse and select videos from a curated library.
- **Real-time Commenting:** While watching a video, users can add comments that appear at specific timestamps, allowing for dynamic interaction.
- **Playback Synchronization:** Comments are displayed in sync with the video, ensuring that viewers can easily relate their thoughts to specific moments.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration, enabling personalized experiences.
- **Interactive Video Playback:** Comment on videos while watching, with comments appearing at precise moments.
- **Rich Video Library:** A variety of videos categorized for easy navigation and discovery.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various devices, ensuring a smooth experience whether on desktop or mobile.
- **Community Engagement:** Users can interact with each otherâ€™s comments, creating a lively discussion around each video.

## Technology Stack

**Galaxy Web App** is built using a robust stack of technologies that ensure performance, scalability, and ease of development:
- **Elixir:** A functional programming language known for its concurrency and fault-tolerance, perfect for building scalable applications.
- **Phoenix Framework:** A web development framework for Elixir that provides high productivity and performance, enabling real-time features via channels.
- **Ecto:** A database wrapper and query generator for Elixir, used for database interactions.
